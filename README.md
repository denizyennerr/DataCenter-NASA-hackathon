# DataCenter-NASA-hackathon

### **What exactly does it do:**
- Kartta is a dashboard that helps urban planners, city governments, and policymakers understand the environmental and social risks associated with the construction and operation of data centers in cities.
- By combining **NASA Earth Observation data** with urban and socioeconomic datasets, **Kartta** generates an interactive, data-driven decision map that supports evidence-based urban planning.
The platform is not about preventing construction, but about helping cities make smarter decisions, identifying the most suitable locations for new data centers, and suggesting mitigation strategies for existing ones. This combination allows users to see and quantify how data centers affect the environment and nearby communities, and to understand what actions can be taken to reduce negative impacts while promoting sustainable digital growth in cities and human settlements.

### **How does it work:**
- We are a data-driven platform that uses a wide range of environmental and urban datasets to generate a comprehensive overview of cities and human settlements.
By combining NASA satellite observations with local information (water resources, energy supply, population density, and household consumption patterns), **Kartta** creates an integrated picture of how urban areas function and evolve.
- This data fusion allows planners and decision-makers to make more accurate, evidence-based decisions about where to locate new data centers and how to improve existing urban areas affected by current ones. In short, we turn complex, multi-source data into clear insights for sustainable urban planning related to data center constructions and maintenance.
